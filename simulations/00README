Use the following y datasets as simulated datasets:
	-simulated_1000poisson_*_*_*_ms_234.rds

1: simulated_1000poisson_1_-0.05_1_ms_234.rds
2: simulated_1000poisson_1_0.05_1_ms_234.rds
3: simulated_1000poisson_2_-0.1_3_ms_234.rds
4: simulated_1000poisson_2_0.1_3_ms_234.rds
5: simulated_1000poisson_2_0_3_ms_234.rds


Use the following neighborhood as simulated neighborhood:
	- simulated_neighbors_1000_poisson.RData


In doing the multiple chains analysis with SRF, 
	run round 1 (myRscript tuning_multiple_chains.R 1)  first until 
	jump probability is properly tuned for all five chains and then 
	run the iterative thing until SRF threshold reached (sh tuning_multiple chains.sh) (change round start to 2)
	!problem: once SRF threshold reached in first try, second round no longer makes jumps

Good results to use:
	- results_multiple_chains_round1_2_-0.1_3.RData
	- results_multiple_chains_round1_2_0_3.RData
	- results_multiple_chains_round1_2_0.1_3.RData
	- results_multiple_chains_round1_1_0.05_1.RData
	- results_multiple_chains_round1_1_-0.05_1.RData

Don't set seed!
