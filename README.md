# Double Metropolis Algorithm in C

## Goal
The overall goal of the project is using Bayesian inference for a Markov Random Field model fitted to gene expression data on the human genome, where the spatial neighborhood information of each gene is inferred from HiC heatmap.

## Model Specification
Please see attached model_specification_2.pdf.

## Double Metropolis Algorithm
Please see attached paper by Liang et al.
