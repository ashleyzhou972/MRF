vector-vector multiplications appears in three places,
 - negpotential.c: calculationg H_i and H_ij for each gene i and j;
 - double_metropolis.c: calculating auxiliary distribution y_auxi;
 - regular_metropolis.c: mrf density


first one MAY be converted to matrix-vector multiplication.
second one CANNOT be convertd, because it is a Gibbs process, i.e. values of y are being updated.
third one can be converted to matrix-vector multiplication. 

The generic function vector_multiplication is found in negpotential.c
